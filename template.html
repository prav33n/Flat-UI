                        <li>The Deep Web is much larger (in excess of 1 trillion pages) and is the portion of the web that is dynamic.  These pages are created in response to a query by a user (e.g., “What are prices for airfare from Chicago to Newark on July 20?").  The trend is for increasing volumes of information to be placed in the Deep Web.  </li>  
                        <li>Glenbrook's platform knows when to go to the Deep Web (and when not to), how to construct the query for a given page, and, once there, how to find and extract desired information efficiently.

                <h6>Glenbrook prides itself in providing its customers – Fortune 100 companies and startups alike - with the client-tailored data services. Major types of these services are described below. </h6>
                <div id='langaugeconversion' class = 'contentPageInner'>
                    <h5>Multi-Language Conversion of Business Records</h5>
                    <p>Global companies deal on a daily basis with the problem of maintaining current and potential customer records. These records are either acquired from third parties (such as D&B) or generated by the companies own sales and marketing organizations. The challenge in leveraging these records is that they are often in different languages and their reconciliation across the company is not an easy task. Not only the language is different but also the conventions on how to describe customer data in different languages are different. For example, the order of address elements in Chinese is reversed from that used in English-speaking countries.</p>

                    <p>Glenbrook has developed a special approach that helps to alleviate the problem. This approach is a combination of record analysis, multiple translation techniques, and fact verification based on postal conventions and company information on the Internet in the target country.</p>

                <div id='business' class = 'contentPageInner' >
                    <h5>Collecting Business Data Worldwide</h5>
                    <p>Businesses are always interested in the most accurate and up-to-date information about their current and potential customers. Internet constitutes one of the most important sources of this information. Companies’ web sites are an excellent source of this information. But only 2% of the information about businesses is on their own web site – 98% of available information is found elsewhere on the Internet (in press releases, articles, blogs, etc.). Furthermore, only a small fraction of the web pages of interest is on Surface Web (the portion of the Web that is accessible through search engines); the rest is located in the Deep Web.  And, to make it even more difficult, the sought information is rarely presented on the web pages in a structured format (in most cases, it appears as free-form text).  Glenbrook's Platform is best suited to collect factual information about businesses and has the ability to navigate the Deep Web, analyze web pages, extract independent contexts from them, and convert semi-structured and unstructured information into structured facts that can be stored in a database.</p>

                <div id='poi' class = 'contentPageInner'>
                    <h5>POI</h5>
                    <p>With the high popularity of mobile geo-based applications, more and more companies are looking to provide their users with detailed and comprehensive information about local businesses, attractions, etc. Internet is a rich source of information on these Points of Interest (POI). Glenbrook collects and refreshes POI information using its ability to aggregate the information collected from across the Internet.</p>
