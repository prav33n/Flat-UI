            <h6>Glenbrook prides itself by providing its customers – Fortune 100 companies and startups alike with the tailored data services. Major types of these services are described below. </h6>
            <div id='langaugeconversion' class = 'contentPage'>
                <h6>Business Record Multi-Language Conversion</h6>
                <p>Global companies deal on a daily basis with the problem of maintaining current and potential customer records. These records are either acquired from a third parties like D&B or generated by the companies own sales and marketing organizations.  The problem is that these records are in different languages and their reconciliation across the company is not an easy task. Not only the language is different but the conventions on how to describe customer record in a different language are different. For example the order of address elements in Chinese is reversed to the one used in English.</p>
                <p>Glenbrook has developed a special approach that helps to alleviate the problem. Glenbrook takes customer records written in one language and converts it to another. It uses its technology platform to do the conversion from language A to language B and then to do verification of the results based on target language country postal conventions and information about corresponding company on the Internet.</p>

                <h6>Collecting Business Data Worldwide</h6>
                <p>Businesses are always interested in the most accurate and up-to-date information about their current and potential customers. Internet constitutes one of the most important sources of this information. Companies own web sites are really good sources of the information. But only 2% of the information about businesses is on their own web site. The rest is somewhere else on the Internet. Furthermore, only a small fraction of the web pages of interest are on Surface Web that is accessible through search engines. The rest is in the Deep Web. Furthermore the sought information is typically presented on the web pages in not a structured format and in most cases is just a free text. So to be able to collect factual information about businesses one needs to have the ability to navigate Deep Web, analyze web page, extract independent contexts from them, and convert semi-structured and unstructured information into structured facts that can be stored in a database.  All these capabilities are part of Glenbrook platform.</p>
